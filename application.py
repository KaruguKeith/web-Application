Flask has three main dependencies. The routing, debugging, and Web Server Gateway
Interface (WSGI) subsystems come from Werkzeug; the template support is provided
by Jinja2; and the command-line integration comes from Click. 

Flask has no native support for accessing databases, validating web forms, authenti‐
cating users, or other high-level tasks. 

These and many other key services most web
applications need are available through extensions that integrate with the core pack‐
ages. As a developer, you have the power to cherry-pick the extensions that work best
for your project, or even write your own if you feel inclined to. This is in contrast
with a larger framework, where most choices have been made for you and are hard or
sometimes impossible to change.

Virtual environments are very useful because they prevent package clutter and ver‐
sion conflicts in the system’s Python interpreter. Creating a virtual environment for
each project ensures that applications have access only to the packages that they use,
while the global interpreter remains neat and clean and serves only as a source from
which more virtual environments can be created. As an added benefit, unlike the
system-wide Python interpreter, virtual environments can be created and managed
without administrator rights.
